# text_generator

#### This project's goal is to test a variety of strategies for AI text generation. Currently, LSTM neural networks are being used for this purpose.

##### Instructions for testing

For the first test, run the following in the command line:

python trainRnn.py char_list 50

All resulting .hdf5 files are to be stored in the data/weights/ subdirectory.
